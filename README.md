### Reflection

For a first game jam, this was pretty exciting to do. This is also a project for my game 
design class, so why not kill two birds with one stone. I wish I could have spent more 
time on this game, but sadly I have other stuff to do in real life. I really was puzzled
on how to make a game aroun the theme of "limited space", so I decided to make take the 
theme literally: 'what is the most limited space I can think of; a maze!'

Triggering the beeps were a lot easier to do than I thought. I wanted to have them play
at certain areas, so I decided on Area2Ds with CollisionShape2Ds to accomplish this. 
In hindsight, I could have made logic that makes the multiple beep sound effects play
when close to the exit point, but I am happy with what I came up with.
